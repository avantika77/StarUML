 STAR UML 

üî∏ StarUML is a software engineering tool for system modeling using the Unified Modeling Language, as well as Systems Modeling Language, and classical modeling notations

:) StarUML supports a variety of UML diagrams, each serving a different purpose in the software development process.

1. Class Diagrams

   A class diagram describes a system‚Äôs classes and the static relationships that exist among them. Class diagrams also show properties and operations of a class. Properties represent the structure of a class and operations    represent the functionality provided by the class.

2. Object Diagram

   Object is an instance of a class in a particular moment in runtime that can have its own state and data values.It shows a snapshot of the detailed state of a system at a point in time.

3. Use-Case Diagram
   
   A Use Case Diagram is a type of Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagram that represents the interaction between actors (users or external systems) and a system under consideration to accomplish specific goals. It            provides a high-level view of the system‚Äôs functionality by illustrating the various ways users can interact with it.

4. Sequence Diagram

   They capture the interaction between objects in the context of a collaboration. Sequence Diagrams are time focus and they show the order of the interaction visually by using the vertical axis of the diagram to represent     time what messages are sent and when. 
  
5. Activity Diagram

   It focuses on illustrating the workflow or sequence of activities, actions, and decisions within a system or a process

6. ER Diagram

   ER diagrams use symbols to represent entities, attributes, and relationships, which help to illustrate the relationships between the entities in the database.
